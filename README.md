Datatable Fixed column version: 3.0.2


Issue with DataTables Fixed columns

The issue here is that even though the scroll bar is appearing the left column is not fixed, so when you move the scroll bar everything moves.

Also if you click on the first TH element in table i.e. (ServerName) the table horizontally expands and contradicts. during this process if you notice carefully the scroll bar get applied to first the outer div with class=tab-content and then to div with class dataTables_scrollBody


I am looking for a solution here so that I can use the Datatable Fixed column plugin successfully
